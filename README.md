# Guess the Fruit 
 
## Introduction and welcome
This game is for my son, Eben. He loves music and in his early months he would only seem to settle to one particular music video on YouTube - it was by a channel called Hey Bear Sensory (recommended to me by a primary school teacher friend). My son loves the images (dancing fruit) and the music, which is always upbeat and fun. When he was 6 months old he smiled and laughed as he watched strawberry's and blueberry's dancing to music. This got me thinking... What if I could make a fun and accesible game for kids that included these fruits and images? How could I make it fun and entertaining AND educational?

[Hey Bear Sensory](https://www.heybearsensory.com/) say... "we invite you to explore our colourful world of animation! Super cute and friendly characters promote happiness, movement, learning, visual tracking, sleep, relaxation and more!" The very nature of this type of medium; music, colourful images and movement, promotes so much of what is needed for young children and their spatial development. It seemed obvious to me to make something that could harness this and put it into the childs hands. So I reached out to Hey Bear Sensory and they were happy for me to design and build a game that incorporated their winning formula and brand into a game. Hey Bear Sensory has millions of views on their YouTube channel - check them out! [Hey Bear Sensory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtf9cFBJkHVAf2qMqF01xYg). 

I am a teacher and having worked with children for years (and having my own child), I can vouch that when sensory experiences are linked to learning, they can be powerful gateways to a child's development and confidence. This game provides the opportunity for parents to engage with their little ones dynamically. This game is about having fun, making links between pressing buttons, making choices and also gives the opportunity to learn about healthy foods! This is all brought together in one place and this is the first time that Hey Bear Sensory can be in the hands of the child (and parents), not just, 'on the telly'.

I believe that this game provides a unique sensory experience, linking Hey Bear's fun with learning can aid with visual tracking, memory and concentration, even word association (should parents sit and explain each fruit by name for example - parents...get creative with this game and get involved!). 
   
So, add Hey Bear's colour, vibrant music and images with a rewarding game experience and you have a winning formula... 

Have fun. (multicoloured text?)

## UX

### Brand and visual identity

The aim of the visuals is to allow this sensory experience to be be accessed all in one place, not only that, the buttons and events were designed to allow for access to children of all abilities, so that all may enjoy interacting with Hey Bear sensory for themselves, not just watching it on the 'telly.'  

Visuals were designed to be obvious, clean and inviting. Much consideration has been given so that the interactive elements of the game are not impeded by branding and clutter. The game's 'buttons' are intuitive - the essentials are on the screen, however, the user (parents also) can get access to info about the game and Hey Bear Sensory's website and YouTube channel through the About button.

There is something for parents as well as the child, you can turn the music on the main game screen 'OFF' - for when those long car journeys, can seem 'longer' when the same music is repeated and repeated and... well, you get the idea.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project is to provide a game that is fun, visually striking and child friendly. It should be easy to understand and lot's of fun for all who play.  The target audience is children between 18 months to...whenever they might feel too old for it (never) and also, parents.


#### Player goals:
* A game that is fun to play.
* Have game controls that are easy to understand.
* Fun and colourful images.
* Music and music videos to reward the player and give information about the game. 

#### Guess the fruit was designed to meet these needs:
* The game was designed with fun and simplicity in mind.
* The game controls/buttons are at a fixed point and easy to see and understand what they do.
* Colours and images have been designed to be obvious and provide visual stimulus.
* Guess the fruit uses visual and audio rewards whilst playing.


#### Parent goals:
Parents have a tough job finding aspects of entertainment that are not 'wasteful' for their children. Hundreds and thousands of games are designed to grab the attention of children and their parent's money, this game is designed to bring an element of fun and colour and music to fruits/food that parents may be trying to introduce to their little ones. Children now have the chance to interact with the visual elements that they have, only thus far, enjoyed through the screen. Now, parents can play with their children and bring this much loved sensory experience out of the screen and into their laps.

* Parents would prefer developmental value in a product.
* The game must be accessible for children of differing abilities.
* The parent can mute the sound.
* There is information about the game for parents and player.

#### Guess the fruit was designed to meet these needs:
* The game was designed to not only be fun; the visuals and gameplay encourage development of memory and visual and spatial awareness.
* The game is easy to understand and is accessible through obvious and intuitive controls.
* There is a mute button for the main game music.
* There is an about button for parents and a 'how to play' modal on game startup.


### User stories

#### Player goals:

-   I want a fun game to play that is easily to understand.
-   I want/need/require child friendly controls. I need the game controls/buttons to be obvious and 'clickable' - large and colourful buttons to attract my attention.
-   I would like fun sounds and images/visuals.
-   I need to be able to recognise the elements within the game.
-   I would love visual and audible rewards when I play/win!

#### Guess the fruit meets the player's needs because:

-   The game is fun, easy to understand, colourful and vibrant.
-   The game controls are obvious, a series on square 'panels' they can touch on screen wth a finger or mouse click and in the form of the fruits that appear in the majority of Hey Bear Sensory's videos (most certainly recognisable by a lot of children as I have surveyed a number of friends with children, all of whom have attested to the fact that Hey Bear Sensory is a popular channel). 
-   The fruits are among the most common out there! Most certainly what children will have seen (and hopefully eaten) before.
-   Plenty of visual and audible stimulus in the form of music and vibrant design.
-   When a game is won, a 'Winner modal' appears and plays a music video.
-   A highscore is also recorded for that play session.


#### Parent goals: 

What would parents like in a game?

-   Developmental value.
-   Is the game accesible?
-   Is the game fun to play?
-   Is it a loud game? What parental controls are there?

#### Guess the fruit meets the parent's needs because:

-   Developmental value: The game is designed to encourage and develop visual, spatial awareness through movement and allows for visual tracking and interaction. 
-   Chidren of all abilities can enjoy the game.
-   Visually appealing and recognisable.
-   Parents can reset the game and there is a mute button!


## Design choices
   
#### Design focus
   - The design focus is intended for mobile devices and tablets - this is because the idea of this game is to be 'handled' by the child, these devices give a unique ability for the child to have more interactivity with the experience - before now, Hey Bear Sensory was viewed on a television screen or monitor - this is the first time that it has been been in the hands of the child. 

- The game has a friendly family-feel design. There is an emphasis on design choices that reflect the desire for the images and visuals to speak for themselves and also to allow for the game to be easily accesible with minimal clutter. 

#### The following design choices were made:
   
* Interactive buttons
   * Buttons were positioned for mobile device and tablets primarily, therefore, the positioning of the image 'buttons' and the header elements was important. I took a decision to switch the ordering of the header buttons on mobile so that a user, (if using the mobile device in one hand for playing and are right handed, as is most often the case), wouldn't accidently hit the mute button. This is the reason that the result window switches and the buttons are shifted to the left on mobile. 
   * the main image buttons are central and the largest part of the visual make-up - the animation bounceIn encourages users interactivity with the buttons, making it easy for the user to understand that these buttons are interactive.

* Colour Scheme
    * Background colour of the main page is black - to allow for images to be striking and bold. Whilst the striking visuals are included as part of the design, the desire was not to overwhelm the user, a muted background allows for the fruit images to be seen clearly and makes it obvious as to the function of the panels the images are contained within.
    * The background colour of any modals and buttons are dark grey to ensure they stand out. 
    * Multicolour text has been included for vibrancy to headers in modals.

* Typography
    * Roboto Mono is used throughout to give a clean, nicely spaced and easily readable aesthetic. The fall back is Sans Serif if, for any reason, Roboto Mono is not imported into the site correctly. 
    * Games on app store were considered when looking at fonts. The decision was that a bold but clear (as it's non-cursive) font would allow for it to be read on screens of varying sizes. 

* Imagery
    * The images picked were intentional - the fruit images are smiling - so that the child is greeted with happy faces from the moment they engage with the game. 
    * Images used are vibrant and colourful - images are recognisable by children who have seen Hey Bear Sensory on YouTube. The images are from several of the videos developed by the brand and will be recognisable by many children.
    * Even if the child playing this game has not seen Hey Bear Sensory videos, the fruits are obvious and friendly!

* Styling
    * !Important - The modals were picked as a way of giving the user the info they needed via the function of either winning the game or when all attempts to find the 'secret fruit' are depleted and they need to 'start-over'. Modals were picked as they 'interrupt' the game only when necessary - not ruining the flow of the game when being played. 
    * (On desktop) Hover effects are used on buttons to allow for depth on the webpage. 

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq during the scope plane part of the design process for this project.

The final version of the wireframe can be found:

## FEATURES
### Existing features
* Responsive on all screen sizes - but primarily designed for mobile devices and tablets.
* Interactive elements.

### Header:
   * This contains the title and main game info and feedback to the player. 
      * About - this is for the parents - gives info about the game and Hear Bear Sensory and also provides links to Hey Bear's website and their YouTube channel.
      * Result/feedback box - this is where the player is told to "Select a fruit" - the obvious position of the message (just above the fruit image panels) tells the player they need to touch one of the panels below. When a player guesses incorrectly a timeout function outputs a message of "Sorry, try again". 
      * Music notes - this 'unmutes' the music so the user can have background music to the game. I decided to mute the music on startup, the player must 'unmute' it. This will bring another functional element into the game - the player must remember to 'turn the music on'.

### Main:
   * This contains the fruit panels/images. These images are used with permission from Hey Bear Sensory and are fruits. A game could be also configured to include vegetables too as that's another key image feature of the Hey Bear brand.
   <div align="center">
   <img src="https://i.ibb.co/ckSYkTT/Fruit-images.png" alt="Fruit_images" border="0">
   </div>

### Footer:
   * This section contains two major elements - scorebox and new game.
      * Scorebox - here, the player can see how many attempts they have left to guess the 'secret fruit' - the number decrements.
      * Best score - here, the player can see how many attempts it took them to guess the 'secret fruit' - the 'best score' is recorded for the remainder of that session or until the player(s) refresh the page.
      * New Game button - to reset the attempts should the user wish to.
      
### Modals:
  1. **Game start modal** 
      - This modal greets the player(s) and gives them very simple instructions on how to play the game... 
      
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/DLDh0zZ/Welcome-modal.png" alt="Welcome_modal screenshot" border="0">
</div>
      
  2. **About modal** 
      - This is a modal primarily for the parents who may choose/desire to know more info about the game.
      
<div align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/g3JpnLr/About-modal.png" alt="About_modal screenshot" border="0">
 </div>
      
  3. **Game over modal**
      - This modal is designed to be simple, yet colourful, and flashing multicolour text suggests losing the game and trying again isn't all that bad!!

</div>

### What I'd like to add in the future 'features'

This is a fluid concept and one that could be added to as the game or whatever brand it connects to grows. I would like to add:
   * A user highscore feature than runs across all sessions and one in local storage. 
   * A play against other people feature - where someone could play against someone else.
   * New game modes where either attempts is lowered for hard mode or even more fruits added.
   * A carousel or a box where fruits are 'jumbled' up and then disappears as a game start feature. 
   * Characters - dancing icons or unique characters to the game.

### Code
* Various sections of my code were inspired by many many Stack Overflow posts which led me to try out various things in order to understand what I was trying to achieve. Some examples are [How to open a bootstrap modal using JQuery](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13183630/how-to-open-a-bootstrap-modal-window-using-jquery) and [how to add an avent after modal is closed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14840870/how-to-add-an-event-after-close-the-modal-window/26934034) which allowed me to figure out some JQuery code I had no knowledge of before. This led me to figuring out how to add a mute button in JQuery and other neat features I would have perhaps given up on had I not ventured into the fun of JQuery! [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/saeedsalam/pen/WNerqrY) Code from Saeed Salam - video mute/unmute button - modified by me for this project - many thanks! 
* SetTimeout function code was inspired by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp)
* Parent function info was inspired by code from these posts [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10960162/javascript-call-parent-function)
* Code (which I modified in JQuery) for animation bounce on the main game panels was from [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/)
* Modified some code for flashing/blinking text for the 'Game Over' modal [HTML Online](https://html-online.com/articles/blinking-text-css-animation/)

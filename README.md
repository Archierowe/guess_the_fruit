# Guess the fruit game

## Introduction and welcome
This game is for my son, Eben. He loves music and in his early months he would only seem to settle to one particular music video on YouTube - it was by a channel called Hey Bear Sensory (recommended to me by a primary school teacher friend). My son loves the images (dancing fruit) and the music, which is always upbeat and uplifting. When whe was 6 months old he always smiled and laughed as he watched strawberry's and blueberry's dancing to music. This got me thinking...

What if I could make a fun and accesible game for kids that included these fruits and images? It would not only be fun and entertaining but educational, as Wayne and Lucie over at Hey Bear Sensory say... "we invite you to explore our colourful world of animation! Super cute and friendly characters promote happiness, movement, learning, visual tracking, sleep, relaxation and more!" So I reached out to Hey Bear Sensory and they were happy for me to design and build a game that incorporated their winning formula into a game. [Hey Bear Sensory] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtf9cFBJkHVAf2qMqF01xYg) has millions of views on their YouTube channel. 

This is the first time that Hey Bear Sensory can be in the hands of the child (and parents) and not just, 'on the telly'. 

I am a teacher myself, and having worked with children for years and having my own child, I can vouch for sensory experiences and when linked to learning are powerful and incredibly succesful gateways to a child's development and confidence. This game provides the opportunity for parents to engage with their little ones dynamically; where having fun and learning about healthy foods is brought together. 

I believe that this game provides a unique sensory experience, linking Hey Bear's fun with learning can aid with visual tracking, memory and concentration, even word association (should parents sit and explain each fruit by name for example - parents, get creative with this game, get involved!). So, add Hey Bear's colour, vibrant music and images with a rewarding game experience and you have a winning formula... 

Have fun.

## UX

### Brand and visual identity

The aim of the visuals is to allow this sensory experience to be be accessed all in one place, not only that, the buttons and events were designed to allow for access to children of all abilities, so that all may enjoy interacting with Hey Bear sensory for themselves, not just watching it on the 'telly.'  

Visuals were designed to be obvious, clean and inviting. Much consideration has been given so that the interactive elements of the game are not impeded by branding and clutter. The game's 'buttons' are intuitive - the essentials are on the screen, however, the user (parents also) can get access to info about the game and Hey Bear Sensory's website and YouTube channel through the About button.

There is something for parents as well as the child, you can turn the music on the main game screen 'OFF' - for when those long car journeys, can seem 'longer' when the same music is repeated and repeated and... well, you get the idea.

## Goals of this project

- The primary goal of this 'Guess the Fruit' game is to be a visually exciting, colourful, child friendly game that will be great fun to play. It has crisp, bright visuals and vibrant sounds.
- The target audience is children between 18 months to whenever they might feel too old for it (never) and also, parents.

### User stories

The game is designed for children aged between 18 months upwards (or whenever a parent might like to introduce thei little one to a game such as this).

#### Player goals:

-   I want a fun game to play that is easily to understand.
-   I want/need/require child friendly controls. I need the game controls/buttons to be obvious and 'clickable' - large and colourful buttons to attract my attention.
-   I would like fun sounds and images/visuals.
-   I need to be able to recognise the elements within the game.
-   I would love visual and audible rewards when I play/win!

#### Guess the fruit meets the player's needs because:

-   The game is fun, easy to understand, colourful and vibrant.
-   The game controls are obvious, a series on square 'panels' they can touch on screen wth a finger or mouse click and in the form of the fruits that appear in the majority of Hey Bear Sensory's videos (most certainly recognisable by a lot of children as I have surveyed a number of friends with children, all of whom have attested to the fact that Hey Bear Sensory is a popular channel). 
-   The fruits are among the most common out there! Most certainly what children will have seen (and hopefully eaten) before.
-   Plenty of visual and audible stimulus in the form of music and vibrant design.
-   When a game is won, a 'Winner modal' appears and plays a music video.
-   A highscore is also recorded for that play session.


#### Parent goals: What do parent goals look like?

Parents have a tough job finding aspects of entertainment that are not 'wasteful' for their children. Hundreds and thousands of games are designed to grab the attention of children, this game is designed to bring an element of fun and colour and music to fruits that Parents may be trying to introduce to their little ones. Children now have the chance to interact with the visual elements that they have, only thus far, enjoyed through the screen. Now, parents can play with their children and bring this much loved sensory experience out of the screen and into their laps.

What would parent's like in a game?

-   Developmental value.
-   Is the game accesible?
-   Is the game fun to play?
-   Is it a loud game? What parental controls are there?

#### Guess the fruit meets the parent's needs because:

-   Developmental value: The game is designed to encourage and develop visual, spatial awareness through movement and allows for visual tracking and interaction. 
-   Chidren of all abilities can enjoy the game.
-   Visually appealing and recognisable.
-   Parents can reset the game.
-   There is a mute button!


## Design choices

The game has a friendly family-feel design. There is an emphasis on design choices that relfect the desire for the images and visuals to speak for themselves and also to allow for the game to be easily accesible with minimal clutter. The following design choices were made:

* Colour Scheme
    * Background colour of the main page is black - to allow for images to be striking and bold. Whilst the striking visuals are included as part of the design, the desire was not to overwhelm the user, a muted background allows for the fruit images to be seen clearly and makes it obvious as to the function of the panels the images are contained within.
    * The background colour of any modals and buttons are dark grey to stand out on the background. 
    * Multicolour text has been included for vibrancy to headers in modals.

* Typography
    * Roboto Mono is used throughout to give a clean, nicely spaced and easily readable aesthetic. The fall back is Sans Serif if, for any reason, Roboto Mono is not imported into the site correctly. 
    * Games on app store were considered when looking at fonts. The decision was that a bold but clear (as it's non-cursive) font would allow for it to be read on screens of varying sizes. 

* Imagery
    * The images picked were intentional - the fruit images are smiling - so that the child is greeted with happy faces from the moment they engage with the game. 
    * Images used are vibrant and colourful - images are recognisable by children who have seen Hey Bear Sensory on YouTube. The images are from several of the videos developed by the brand and will be recognisable by many children.
    * Even if the child playing this game has not seen Hey Bear Sensory videos, the fruits are obvious and friendly!

* Styling
    * !Important - The modals were picked as a way of giving the user the info they needed via the function of either winning the game or when all attempts to find the 'secret fruit' are depleted and they need to 'start-over'. Modals were picked as they 'interrupt' the game only when necessary - not ruining the flow of the game when being played. 
    * (On desktop) Hover effects are used on buttons to allow for depth on the webpage. 

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq during the scope plane part of the design process for this project.

The final version of the wireframe can be found:

## FEATURES
### Existing features

* Responsive on all screen sizes - but primarily designed for tablets.
* Interactive elements.

## Elements

   * Header:
   * This contains the title and main game info and feedback to the player. 
      * About - this is for the parents - gives info about the game and Hear Bear Sensory and also provides links to Hey Bear's website and their YouTube channel.
      * Result/feedback box - this is where the player is told to "Select a fruit" - the obvious position of the message (just above the fruit image panels) tells the player they need to touch one of the panels below. When a player guesses incorrectly a timeout function outputs a message of "Sorry, try again". 
      * Music notes - this 'unmutes' the music so the user can have background music to the game. I decided to mute the music on startup, the player must 'unmute' it. This will bring another functional element into the game - the player must remember to 'turn the music on'.

   * Main:
   * This contains the fruit panels/images. These images are used with permission from Hey Bear Sensory and are fruits. A game could be also configured to include vegetables too as that's another key image feature of the Hey Bear brand.
   ![fruit images](https://github.com/Archierowe/guess_the_fruit/blob/master/gifs/fruit_images.png)

   * Footer:
   * This section contains two major elements - scorebox and new game.
      * Scorebox - here, the player can see how many attempts they have left to guess the 'secret fruit' - the number decrements.
      * Best score - here, the player can see how many attempts it took them to guess the 'secret fruit' - the 'best score' is recorded for the remainder of that session or until the player(s) refresh the page.
      * New Game button - to reset the attempts should the user wish to.

   * Modals:
      * Startup modal - this modal greets the player(s) and gives them very simple instructions on how to play the game...
      ![Welcome modal on startup](https://github.com/Archierowe/guess_the_fruit/blob/master/gifs/welcome_modal.png)
      * 'game over' modal - this modal - this is 'loseModal' in the code - so it was easy to understand in that context. This modal is a very simple modal - 'Game Over' image and New Game button to get the player back in the game. 
      ![Lose modal when attempts used up](https://github.com/Archierowe/guess_the_fruit/blob/master/gifs/game_over_modal.png)
      * About modal - this is the modal for parents and anyone interested in knowing more about the game and why it was designed. 
      * ![About the game modal](https://github.com/Archierowe/guess_the_fruit/blob/master/gifs/about_modal.png)


      

Numerous features were designed to give a simple, intuitive and fun user experience.

-   I used a sitewide alert to point to sale information for the user - with a clickable link to take them to the Book a lesson page - easy and simple to use.
-   Fade In/Down welcome text on the home page, intended to draw the user into the site, creating a visually pleasing experience. 
-   Background video on home page - intention to create an experience for the user - to draw them into the 'live' feel of playing in a studio. Visual appeal.
-   The use of buttons throughout the site - intended to take the user clearly and simply to the areas of interest. Simple, intuitive navigation. 
-   The use of a YouTube video and MP3 player gives the user direct access to the 'sound of the Academy' - gives them the opportunity to experience and be drawn in to the atmosphere of Arco Academy. 
-   The calendly links give quick and visual access to the lessons and masterclasses available to them for immediate planning and accessibility - giving the user control over bookings and enquiries.

The site uses various features, many of which are native to bootstrap:

-   Forms and question boxes - such as those seen on Book a lesson and Masterclass pages. 
-   Buttons  - site wide use of buttons.
-   Modal windows on [What we offer](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/what-we-offer.html) page to display information about lessons for beginners.
-   Modal windows on [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) page to display calendly link to book lessons.
-   Modal windows on [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) page to display calendly link to book slots for masterclasses.
-   On mobile devices some buttons disappear and content text (from about page) disappears to allow for a more fluid user experience.
-   Flexbox classes used to keep content fixed, regardless of content size.

### FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT

-   Ideally, I would have liked to have produced/designed features that gave a more 'tactile' experience - buttons that made sounds or given some nods to drum sound effects. 
    However, this meant using languages that were outside of the scope of this project - Javascript for example. 

## TESTING

![Arco Drum Academy website on different screensizes](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/devices-display.png)

The site was tested on various platforms to ensure it displays across different screen sizes.

Form validation was tested on both the [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) and [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) pages. This was done to ensure that the Calendly links worked well across all formats and that when a user asks a question it is sent to the business. 

### Gif to illustrate how the Book a lesson works

-   User clicks on book a lesson button.
-   This takes them to the Calendly select a day - a date then which they can select.
-   this then takes them to selecting a time on the selected day.
-   They then enter their contact details and a question (if they have one).
-   They can then select close.

![Book a lesson process](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/book-a-lesson.gif)



### Gif to illustrate what happens when a question is submitted

-   User enters personal details on the Book a lesson page and enters a question (email is required).
-   The details are then sent to external source (in this case Formspree).
-   Users enquiry arrives at email source (in this case my gmail),

![ask a question process](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/ask-a-question.gif)

The HTML and CSS was validated on [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and speed tested on [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/)

### Issues, challenges and bugs

-   Numerous challenges presented themselves through this endeavour:
-   Have had difficulty in implementation of game logic. Had inspiration from various 'guess the number games' from the folks at Udemy [Udemy - Jonas Schmedtmann] (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) and also [Udemy - Bryson Payne] (https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-kids). Game logic was dificult to realise as I had to figure out how to pull objects out of an array - a combination of these helped: [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute) and also [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) All led to some interesting finds and brought me to things like the forEach() method and using input and class to utilise data-fruit.

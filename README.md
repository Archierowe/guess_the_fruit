# Guess the fruit game

## DESCRIPTION




## UX

USE THIS IN ACKKNOWLEDGEMENTS section - I have been given permission to use images from the brand for the purposes of this project [Hey Bear Sensory - thanks to Wayne!] (https://www.heybearsensory.com/)

## Goals of this project

- The primary goal of this 'Guess the Fruit' game is to be a visually exciting, colourful, child friendly game that will be great fun to play. It has crisp, bright visuals and vibrant sound.
- The target audience is children between 1 and 5 and also, parents!

### User stories

The game is designed for children aged between 1-5 years old.

#### Player goals:

-   I want a fun game to play that is easily to understand.
-   I want/need/require child friendly controls.
-   I need the game controls/buttons to be obvious and 'clickable' - large and colourful buttons to attract my attention.
-   I would like fun sounds and images/visuals.
-   I need to be able to recognise the elements within the game.
-   I would love visual and audible rewards when I play/win!

#### Guess the fruit meets the player's needs because:

-   The game has visual appeal and was actually inspired by a series of YouTube videos from a company called [Hey Bear Sensory] (https://www.heybearsensory.com/). The videos are designed to capture the attention of young children through colourful images of fruit and veg accompanied by free to use music from Youtube. (I have been given permission to use images from the brand [Hey Bear Sensory - thanks to Wayne!] (https://www.heybearsensory.com/).
-   The game is fun, colourful and vibrant - most certainly recognisable by a lot of children (I have surveyed a number of friends with children, all of whom have attested to the fact that Hey Bear Sensory is a popular channel - which has millions upon millions of viewers globally). 
-   The game is obervably obvious with a carousel of fruit which then disappears - the user then has a number of fruits to 'push' on screen. If the user guesses which one is hidden then they win! They have 9 attempts and the best score is recorded.  
-   The game controls are obvious and in the form of the fruits that appear in the majority of Hey Bear Sensory's videos.
-   The sounds and images are also from hey Bear Sensory. 
-   The fruits are among the most common out there! Most certainly what children will have seen (and hopefully eaten) before.
-   Plenty of visual and audible stimulus in the form of music and vibrant design.


#### Parent goals: What do parent goals look like?

Parents have a tough job finding aspects of entertainment that are not 'wasteful' for their children. Hundreds and thousands of games are designed to grab the attention of children, this game is designed to partner with Hey Bear Sensory and bring an element of fun to be enjoyed that children have not yet experienced from this channel/brand. They now have the chance to interact with the visual elements that they have, only thus far, enjoyed through the screen. Now, parents can play with their children and bring this, much loved, experience out of the screen and into their laps.

What would parent's like in a game?

-   Developmental value?
-   Is the game accesible?
-   Is the game fun to play?
-   Is it a loud game? What parental controls are there?

#### Guess the fruit meets the parent's needs because:


-   Develpmental value. The game is designed to encourage visual and spatial awareness.
-   Chidren of varying abilities can enjoy the game.
-   Visually appealing and recognisable.
-   Parents can reset the game.
-   There is a mute button!


The site acts responsively based on screen-size.


## WIREFRAME

A detailed wire frame was designed to ensure the organisation and flow of content for desktop and mobile versions of the website.

The final version of the wireframe can be found [here](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/arco-wireframe.pdf)


## FEATURES

Numerous features were used with the intention of giving a simple and intuitive, yet pleasant user experience.

-   I used a sitewide alert to point to sale information for the user - with a clickable link to take them to the Book a lesson page - easy and simple to use.
-   Fade In/Down welcome text on the home page, intended to draw the user into the site, creating a visually pleasing experience. 
-   Background video on home page - intention to create an experience for the user - to draw them into the 'live' feel of playing in a studio. Visual appeal.
-   The use of buttons throughout the site - intended to take the user clearly and simply to the areas of interest. Simple, intuitive navigation. 
-   The use of a YouTube video and MP3 player gives the user direct access to the 'sound of the Academy' - gives them the opportunity to experience and be drawn in to the atmosphere of Arco Academy. 
-   The calendly links give quick and visual access to the lessons and masterclasses available to them for immediate planning and accessibility - giving the user control over bookings and enquiries.

The site uses various features, many of which are native to bootstrap:

-   Forms and question boxes - such as those seen on Book a lesson and Masterclass pages. 
-   Buttons  - site wide use of buttons.
-   Modal windows on [What we offer](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/what-we-offer.html) page to display information about lessons for beginners.
-   Modal windows on [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) page to display calendly link to book lessons.
-   Modal windows on [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) page to display calendly link to book slots for masterclasses.
-   On mobile devices some buttons disappear and content text (from about page) disappears to allow for a more fluid user experience.
-   Flexbox classes used to keep content fixed, regardless of content size.

### FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT

-   Ideally, I would have liked to have produced/designed features that gave a more 'tactile' experience - buttons that made sounds or given some nods to drum sound effects. 
    However, this meant using languages that were outside of the scope of this project - Javascript for example. 

## TESTING

![Arco Drum Academy website on different screensizes](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/devices-display.png)

The site was tested on various platforms to ensure it displays across different screen sizes.

Form validation was tested on both the [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) and [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) pages. This was done to ensure that the Calendly links worked well across all formats and that when a user asks a question it is sent to the business. 

### Gif to illustrate how the Book a lesson works

-   User clicks on book a lesson button.
-   This takes them to the Calendly select a day - a date then which they can select.
-   this then takes them to selecting a time on the selected day.
-   They then enter their contact details and a question (if they have one).
-   They can then select close.

### Gif to illustrate what happens when a question is submitted

-   User enters personal details on the Book a lesson page and enters a question (email is required).
-   The details are then sent to external source (in this case Formspree).
-   Users enquiry arrives at email source (in this case my gmail),

The HTML and CSS was validated on [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and speed tested on [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/)

### Issues, challenges and bugs

-   Numerous challenges presented themselves through this endeavour:
-   Have had difficulty in implementation of game logic. Had inspiration from various 'guess the number games' from the folks at Udemy [Udemy - Jonas Schmedtmann] (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course) and also [Udemy - Bryson Payne] (https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-for-kids). Game logic was dificult to realise as I had to figure out how to pull objects out of an array - a combination of these helped: [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute) and also [MDN] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) All led to some interesting finds and brought me to things like the forEach() method and using input and class to utilise data-fruit.

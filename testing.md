[Play the game in GitHub pages](https://archierowe.github.io/guess_the_fruit/)

## User stories testing

Working through the user stories section of the [README.md](README.md)

**Player goals**

1. **I want a fun game to play that is easily to understand.**

- The game is vibrant, and colourful. The start game modal appears upon a new game session with simple instructions. However, the game is designed to be simple and intuitive.

2. **I want/need/require child friendly controls. I need the game controls/buttons to be obvious and 'clickable' - large and colourful buttons to attract my attention.**

- The game controls are obvious and appear in the form of very vibrant and colourful images of fruit - the main 'hero' images.

3. **I would like fun sounds and images/visuals.**

- The game has background music that is turn on and off'able'. The control for this is a mute sound button which is intuitive and instantly recognisable as sound on and off icon(s).
- The visuals are in the form of colourful fruit which bounce in when a new game starts (when the page is refreshed or the main new game button is pressed/clicked).

4. **I need to be able to recognise the elements within the game.**

- The visuals are fruits are among the most common and certainly fruit that most children will have seen (and hopefully eaten) before.

5. **I would love visual and audible rewards when I play/win!**

- - When a game is 'won' and the hidden fruit is found a win game modal appears giving the player stimulus in the form of a music video to celebrate their win.

**Parent goals**

1. **Developmental value.**

- Guess the Fruit provides an experience for the child that is not only fun but educational in a umber of ways...
  - Visual and spatial awareness through the movement of the various elements within the game:
    - The visual rewards upon winning the game offer incentive and encourage concentration.
    - The overall experience encourages interaction and can also provide an element of memory exercising - the player needs to remember which buttons they have alredy tried in guessing the fruit.

2. **Is the game accesible?**

- The game buttons bounce in for the player/child, making it obvious that these buttons are intended for operation of the game.
- Modals offer extra information to the parent - for example the about modal provides the parent with valuable information about the brand Hery Bear Sensory for extra information and potential educational resources.

3. **Is the game fun to play?**

- The game is visually very appealing and colourful, intentional in it's vibrancy and sounds in attracting the player whilst being easy and intuitive.

4. **Is it a loud game? What parental controls are there?**

- Parents can reset the game at anytime via refrwshing the page and also a new game button.
- Parents are able to mute the game and control the volume via the main volume output controls for whatever device they are using.
